# A Bookkeeping Application

## About this bookkeeping application

Money is inseparable from our daily life. Sometimes we spend, and sometimes we receive them.
Don't you want to know how much you spend every day, how much you earn, and where they are spent?

My bookkeeping application allows users to record their financial activities.
Features are:
- recording spending
- recording incomes
- calculating daily total spending
- calculating daily total incomes
- clearly displaying financial summary with dates
- allowing to note the source of income and where the money is spent

## Target user groups
This application will be more targeted to **young people** (such as college students) who have a small expenses but 
complex consumption fields and want to quickly summarize their financial 
situation and make a plan. The app can also be used by **middle-aged people** to keep track of daily expenses
(such as on clothes, groceries, etc.), along with their incomes to see if they earn more
or spent more.

However, it may not be suitable for *seniors* because users need to manually enter each of their expenses
and income so there is a chance of error, and seniors may have a greater chance of making mistakes on a less 
familiar application and device. Misunderstandings can be caused to older people if they don't know that a
mistake has been made.

## My interests on this project

The reason I am interested in this project is that I feel I am in need of such an app to record and summarize 
my financial activities. For me I spend different amounts every day on different things (food, clothes, books, etc. 
all cost money). I also have a part-time job, so I have regular income. I wish I could design an app to log them, so 
I can figure out if I've saved up, and remind me if I need to change my lifestyle? Spending a little at a time doesn't 
get my attention, but summing them up will reveal whether I need to cut back.
